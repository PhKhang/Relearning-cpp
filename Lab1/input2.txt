From a Marxist and Leninist perspective, differences in opinion can be understood as being influenced by the social, economic, and cultural conditions that shape individuals' experiences and worldviews. Marxism and Leninism hold that individuals are shaped by their social and historical context, including their class position, education, cultural background, and political orientation.

Therefore, the fact that two people looking at the same thing can come up with different opinions reflects the ways in which individuals are socially constructed and influenced by their unique circumstances. For example, a person who has experienced poverty and deprivation may view a 6 as a good outcome, whereas a person who has had more privilege and resources may view a 6 as a poor outcome.

In Marxist and Leninist thought, the solution to the problem of differing opinions is to work towards a society in which everyone has equal access to resources and the ability to participate in decision-making processes. This would involve working to eliminate the class-based and other forms of inequalities that create different perspectives and experiences among individuals. In this way, Marxism and Leninism aim to create a more equitable and just society in which individuals are free to express their opinions and perspectives without being constrained by their social or economic circumstances.
